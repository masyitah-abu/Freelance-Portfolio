# MY PORTFOLIO

# [Project 1: Homomorphic Filtering](https://github.com/masyitah-abu/Homomorphic-Filtering) 
- This project is about image processing to remove noise from raw image
- The step to remove noise in Image are :-
 - Add noise in raw image
 - Build 3 class of homomorphic filtering
 - Represent the data output in MSE

# [Project 2: Emotion Recognition using SVM](https://github.com/masyitah-abu/Emotion-Recogntion-using-SVM) 
- This project are refer from https://github.com/gomanajah/Emotion-Estimation-From-Facial-Images
- Only 7 Expression databased is used in my project 
- The method used in this project are LBP as feature extraction and SVM as classification
- The dataset output will be represent in Confussion Matrix

# [Project 3: Malay Command Recognition using ANN](https://github.com/masyitah-abu/Malay-Command-Recognition-using-ANN) 
- This project is to give command in malay language to on or off electrical appliance like fan and light
- Four command is choose to BUKA KIPAS, TUTUP KIPAS, BUKA LAMPU and TUTUP LAMPU
- The method used in this project are Signal filtering using low pass filter, MFCC as feature extraction and ANN as classification
- This is my final year project the thesis and the slide will be upload togther.

# [Project 4: Steel defect detection using Transfer Learning](https://github.com/masyitah-abu/Steel-defect-detection-using-transfer-learning)
- This project is done analysis on steel defect detection performance using several types of transfer learning
- In this project 2 types of dataset is used.
 - NEU: 6 class of steel defects
 - SERVESTAL: with defect and without defect
- In this project GUI is include for NEU dataset on the best transfer learning method  
- This project is publish in IOP Publication https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1755/1/012041/meta

# [Project 5: Classification of Multiple Visual Field using CNN](https://github.com/masyitah-abu/Classification-of-Multiple-Visual-Field-Defects-using-CNN)
- This project is done to detect 6 types of visual field defect using Convolutional Neural Network 
- This project is colabration with USM Opthalmology department  
- This project had publish in IOP Publication https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1755/1/012014/meta

# [Project 6: Sentiment Analysis for Twitter Data](https://github.com/masyitah-abu/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Twitter-Data) 
- This project is analyse tweet done by Malaysian during 30 day before and after election day 2018.
- The package used to analyse the data is tweepy
